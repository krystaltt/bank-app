### Instructions to Setup:

### Note:

Make sure that ports 3000 and 3007 are both available for our back-end and front-end servers.

#### Prerequest:

Install Node.js and npm

#### Setting up Back-end:

1. Open a Terminal (in bank-app)

2. Navigate to the `authInMern` folder:

```bash
   cd authInMern
```

3. Move into the `server` folder:

```bash
   cd server
```

4. Install all the dependencies for the back-end:

```bash
   npm install
```

5. Run the back-end:

```bash
   npm start
```

Tip: If error occurs when running the back-end side, is bcrypt_lib.node is not a valid Win32 application, try to remove the node_modules and then repeat the No.4 step to install all dependencies.

#### Setting up Front-end:

1. Open another Terminal (in bank-app)

2. Navigate to the `client` folder:

```bash
   cd client
```

3. Install all the dependencies for the front-end:

```bash
   npm install
```

4. Run the front-end:

```bash
   npm start
```

### Usage:

Visit [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/) in your web browser to access the bank app.
